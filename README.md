# line_following_robo_car

Arduino is used in this project.

Here the robo-car follows a black line detected using 5 infrared sensors.
The infrared sensors need to be calliberated to detect the black line.

Before uploading the arduino code into your Arduino board check the pins for motors and IR sensors.
After making the necessary changes your robo-car is ready to follow the black line!!
